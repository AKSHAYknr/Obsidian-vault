# ðŸŸ¢ What is Hoisting?

ðŸ‘‰ **Hoisting** means that during the **creation phase** of the Execution Context, **JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope (memory is reserved before execution starts).**

- But! Only **declarations** are hoisted, not **initializations/assignments**.

# ðŸŸ¢ In Short

1. **Variables with `var`** â†’ hoisted but initialized as `undefined`.
    
2. **Variables with `let` & `const`** â†’ hoisted but in **TDZ** (canâ€™t use before declaration).
    
3. **Function declarations** â†’ hoisted fully (safe to call before definition).
    
4. **Function expressions / arrow functions** â†’ hoisted as variables (so not callable before definition).
