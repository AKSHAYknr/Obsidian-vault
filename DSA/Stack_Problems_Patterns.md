# ðŸ”¹ What is a Stack?

- **Stack** is a **linear data structure** that follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
    
- Last element pushed into stack is the first one popped out.
    
- Think of a **stack of books** â€” you can only take the top one.

# ðŸ”¹ Common Stack Methods in Java

| Method                               | Description                          | Example             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `push(E e)`                          | Insert element at top                | `stack.push(10);`   |
| `pop()`                              | Remove and return top element        | `stack.pop();`      |
| `peek()`                             | Look at top element without removing | `stack.peek();`     |
| `isEmpty()`                          | Check if stack is empty              | `stack.isEmpty();`  |
| `size()`                             | Number of elements                   | `stack.size();`     |
| `search(Object o)` (only in `Stack`) | Find 1-based position from top       | `stack.search(20);` |
